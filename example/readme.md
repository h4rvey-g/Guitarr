This folder contains the example BAM file and GTF file, which are corresponding the human genome hg19 (GRCh37).

You need to download a hg19 (GRCh37) genome sequence file (.fasta) for testing your installation. hg19 genome fasta files could be download from ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/currentGenomes/Homo_sapiens/chromosomes/ for each chromosome, and need to merge to one fasta file and index it. Or download from Gencode at https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/release_39lift37.html.
